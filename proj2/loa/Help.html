<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece.
The goal of the game is to get all of one's pieces into one group of pieces that are connected.
Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first.
Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board.
A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures.
A piece must move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action).
This line contains both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece is on.
A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
By default, the player plays as Black against an AI. To toggle manual and AI players, select from the menu titled Players. Note that if both players are set to AI, the game will run until completion.
To select a piece to move, click on its square and observe that it will be highlighted in blue.
Click on another valid square to move your piece.
To deselect your piece, click on an illegal square or another of your pieces.
